The Odin Project: Landing Page project using Cas' UX design as inspo!

This project will help me develop my HTML layout and site organization skills first. Once that part is complete, I will go back over it to add CSS and JS as I work through those lessons.

The goal is to recreate [this website wireframe](https://app.uizard.io/p/cec32750) created by Cas Marlatt.
